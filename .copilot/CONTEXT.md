# BraceYourself – Project Context

BraceYourself is a browser‑based bracelet pattern editor designed to give the user a more powerful, intuitive, and modern interface than BraceletBook, while still exporting patterns in a format compatible with BraceletBook’s submission system.

The application provides:
- A grid‑based pattern editor
- A large library of built‑in templates
- Image import and quantization to convert photos into patterns
- Palette and color management tools
- Export and print functionality
- Mobile‑friendly UI
- Local persistence of designs
- A guided onboarding experience

The project is intentionally dependency‑free:
- No build tools
- No npm
- Native ES6 modules only
- Works entirely in the browser

The goal is to maintain 100% functional parity with the original monolithic version while improving maintainability, modularity, and long‑term extensibility.
